# SDC_3D_Simulator
Self-Driving Car 3D Simulator in Python<br>
The 3Dv2 and the Simulator3D are the main scripts, each one of these scripts is a separated algorithm. I finished them after taking the Self-driving car Udacity free course. The 3Dv2 process the algorithm at first, finished this work, and shows the graphics instead. The other one shows you a "real-time" version of the self-driving process.<br><br>

Requirements:<br>
   - Python3
   - Vpython(visual python)
